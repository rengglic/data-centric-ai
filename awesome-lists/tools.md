## Data Programming & Weak Supervision
- [Cleanlab](https://github.com/cgnorthcutt/cleanlab): A Python library for machine learning with noisy labels. It supports finding label errors in datasets and training models on noisily labeled data.
- [Knodle](http://knodle.cc/): A modular Python framework that allows combining different classifiers, weak supervision approaches and denoising methods.
